# PhishingSpam
A little program I whipped together to spam a fake phishing site with tons of fake information to slow down their servers, bury their real results among some fake ones, and ultimately, to waste their time as much as possible.

All data fields are randomly generated:
- First Names come from two lists, one each for the 1000 entries each of the most common male and female names.
- Surnames from a list of 980 real surnames.
- Streets from a massive list (over 4800 streets) of all old and real street names from London England (to reduce the likelihood of producing real addresses).
- Cities and provinces from a list of all Canadian cities (3400).

All other information is generated at random within certain criteria to make them appear as realistic as possible.

Feel free to change to download the code and mutate it as needed to spam your own phishing scammers!
